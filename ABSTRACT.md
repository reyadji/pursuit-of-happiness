Based on World Happiness Report dataset, I tried to gain some insights into what makes people around the world happy and find some actionable suggestion. My research questions revolve around economy as the most significant predictor of happiness. I was using common statistical method, such as Pearson correlation coefficient and single linear regression to confirm or reject my hypothesis. I found that economy is indeed the biggest factor in predicting happiness, but family (social support) has very similar correlation, and trust in government drives the biggest change in happiness sentiment. Not all my hypothesis are answered. I still don't know why Americans are getting less happy each year. There are several limitations in doing this study, mainly inaccessible raw Gallup survey results to confirm the accuracy. All things considered, World Happiness Report is a very solid first step in understanding and quantifying factors that make up happiness
